Common Prefix is a team of engineers and scientists committed to pioneering advancements in blockchain technology. We specialize in bridging the gap between academic rigor and industry practices focusing on Layer-1 and Layer-2 technologies, interoperability, scalability, and usability of distributed ledgers.

In partnership with leading networks such as Axelar, Babylon, Celestia, Harmony, MystenLabs and Snowfork we actively utilize our GitHub organization to share cutting-edge projects developed by our team. We believe that open-sourcing projects and ideas cultivates a collaborative environment that rapidly propels the blockchain community forward.

Some of the projects that we're currently building are:
* [Axelar light client](https://github.com/commonprefix/axelar-light-client): An Ethereum prover/verifier implementation of a light client that employs the Sync Committee protocol of Ethereum to bridge events from Ethereum to Axelar with existential honesty assumptions.
* [State prover](https://github.com/commonprefix/state-prover): A simple API for generating proofs from the Ethereum beacon state using a Lodestar node.
* [Block roots archive](https://github.com/commonprefix/block-roots-archive): A caching layer including a data scraper and a server designed to aggregate and provide access to all the block roots within a single Sync Committee period of the Beacon API of Ethereum.
* [Axelar <> XRPL Integration](https://github.com/commonprefix/axelar-xrpl-relayer): An integration of Axelar with the Ripple Chain consisting of a [relayer](https://github.com/commonprefix/axelar-xrpl-relayer) and the [contracts](https://github.com/commonprefix/axelar-xrpl-solidity).
* [Ancestry Prover](): An all-in-one solution for proving that a beacon block is a predecessor of another beacon block.
  
Projects developed by us, hosted on other organizations:
* [Flare Wraps](https://github.com/flrfinance/flr-wraps-contracts): A multisig-based ETH <> Flare bridge currently holding more than 3M USD TVL, consisting of a [validator](https://github.com/flrfinance/flr-wraps-validator) and the [contracts](https://github.com/flrfinance/flr-wraps-contracts).
* [Patronum](https://github.com/lightclients/patronum): An Ethereum RPC proxy that verifies RPC responses against given trusted block hashes.
* [Kevlar](https://github.com/lightclients/kevlar): A CLI tool that utilized Patronum to run a light client-based RPC Proxy for PoS Ethereum. Kevlar can be used to make Metamask or any RPC-based wallet completely trustless.
* [Phygitals](https://github.com/flrfinance/phygital-redemptions-contracts): A production-ready implementation of the [Ermis](https://enosys.global/papers/ermisWhitepaper.pdf) protocol, that enables users to redeem NFTs on-chain and get the corresponding physical item delivered by the vendor â€“ all without implicating any third-party service. More about the protocol can be found in [this](https://enosys.medium.com/phygitals-part-1-f2f3aa7ede69) series of posts.

Projects we've collaborated to:
* [Harmony](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony). The core consensus implementation of the Harmony protocol. We implemented several bug fixes, discovered in our [technical report](https://www.commonprefix.com/static/clients/harmony/harmony_tech_report_v2.pdf).
* [Lens Recommender](https://github.com/Karma3Labs/ts-lens): A project utilizing the [Eigentrust Algorithm](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/eigentrust.pdf) to generate multiple reputation rankings for users living on the Lens Social Network.
